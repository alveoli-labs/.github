# Alveoli Labs

**Building the future of open source collaboration**

Alveoli Labs is the company behind GitMesh, an AI-powered Git collaboration platform designed to solve contributor onboarding and project management challenges in open source software development.

## Our Mission

Open source projects lack the organizational infrastructure that exists in corporate environments. Contributors struggle to find appropriate tasks, maintainers spend excessive time on onboarding, and enterprises face security risks when adopting open source dependencies. Alveoli Labs addresses these challenges through intelligent automation and enterprise-grade tooling.
