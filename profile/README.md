# Alveoli

**Build what wins, not what's loud.**

Alveoli Labs is the company behind GitMesh, Market-driven development automated.

## Our Mission

GitMesh correlates market signals with engineering telemetry to auto-generate ranked backlogs, sprint plans, and work routing - fully synced across your dev stack.

## What We Build

### GitMesh

GitMesh watches thousands of signals across GitHub, Reddit, X, Discord, Stack Overflow, and beyond - then correlates them with your team's actual capacity and sprint progress. Instead of manually triaging feedback or guessing priorities, you get auto-generated GitHub issues ranked by impact, ICP fit, and competitive gaps. It maps work to the right engineers, syncs milestones across your stack, and even guides implementation - so your team ships what users need, not just what they asked for.

GitMesh is open source and available at: [github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/gitmesh](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/gitmesh)
